# Tribute-Page

Similar to the survey form this was smoother the html seem to be a plug and play formate when you just use the "view page source" not reccomending because 1. i do not know who would want to reuse code public and 2 The security vunerabilities will F**k you over big time especially when it comes to scaling and ensuring the safty of information to avoid breaches. hence why using ai to generate code is not better they are trained on code that has not met or passed a prerequisite for security reasons. Grabbing the page source allows you to modify and secure a code already existing. This is not new discovery just something to not in the event you want to sharpen your html or js, no need just have a chunck of snippets to have specific lines for your site/app to be functional
